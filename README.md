# Tiny Tunes

## Exercise
In this exercise you will start working against (pun intended) the DOM-API. 

For this exercise it is ok to place the code needed in index.js. Later on we will look at separating our javascript in a cleaner way. If you like, please go ahead and place the code in a separate helper module.

Start the exercise by:
```bash
npm i
```
followed by:
```bash
npm start
```

The instructions will be served via index.html
